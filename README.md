  <h1>MLOPS</h1>
  <p>MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that extends DevOps principles to the machine learning (ML) lifecycle, focusing on automating and standardizing the processes for designing, developing, deploying, and monitoring ML models. The goal of MLOps is to streamline the end-to-end management of ML models in production, ensuring faster, more reliable, and repeatable deployment and maintenance by fostering collaboration between data scientists, software engineers, and operations teams. </p>

  <h2>Key concepts</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Collaboration & Communication</strong> — Align data scientists, ML engineers, developers and ops teams.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong> — Frequent integration, tests for code, data and models.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Deployment (CD)</strong> — Automate testing, packaging, versioning and deployment of models.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Monitoring & Management</strong> — Monitor performance, detect data/model drift, trigger retraining.</li>
    <li><strong>Version Control</strong> — Track code, data, model artifacts (e.g., Git + DVC + model registry).</li>
    <li><strong>Automated Testing</strong> — Unit tests, data quality checks, robustness checks, integration tests.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure Management</strong> — Containerization, orchestration, resource management (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform).</li>
    <li><strong>Data Management</strong> — Consistent pipelines, governance, privacy and reproducibility.</li>
  </ol>
